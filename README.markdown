Spage
=

Simple flat file CMS written in PHP. Each page gets its own *.html file which is served for users and *.txt file is kept for maintenance purposes. 

* Create new content by using Markdown
    * Live preview is shown while creating new pages using Showdown.js
* Templates are done using Mustache.php
* Individual pages can be edited
* All pages can be rebuilt if there is a need to change the markup
* Deleting of pages is not implemented

Showdown, Mustache and Markdown have their own licenses (can be found in those files), but feel free to do what ever you want with spage.php.
